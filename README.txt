Hello! And welcome to the speedometer extreme! This project is currently under construction :(

However, feel free do download and try it out! the speedometer is currently functioning. If it does
not work on your device, please email me @ James.Tauzin@BronzeSwordStudios.com.

App is constructed in Kotlin and utilizes the internal GPS to calculate speed based on change
in position.

Best,

James Tauzin
